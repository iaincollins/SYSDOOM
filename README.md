Dr. Doom's own programming language, inspired by Unbeatable Squirrel Girl issue #4

Rather than mimic that directly I'm going to base this off Cow (http://esolangs.org/wiki/COW), which it itself a variant of Brainfuck (http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).
I wrote a Brainfuck interpreter for shits'n'giggles back in college so I'm going to re-use that because I'm a lazy git.
